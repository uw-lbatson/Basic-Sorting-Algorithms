# Java-SortingAlgos

This is a Java project that showcases two sorting algorithms, bubble sort and insertion sort.

Greenfoot is required to use the project, the folder can be downloaded to open the 'project' file.

To change which sorting algorithm is showcased, the SortingVisualizer class can be edited.
There is a capitalized comment where you can uncomment and comment which algorithm you do or
do not want to see.

Currently,
'''
BubbleSortVisualizer sort = new BubbleSortVisualizer();
addObject(sort,1,1);
'''
is uncommented, which displays bubble sort, uncomment both the variable definition and addObject
for the specific algorithm to work.

An unsolved and solved state can be seen below:
